## § Kotlin

Kotlin은 2012년 JetBrains에서 만든 오픈소스 프로그래밍 언어로, 안드로이드 앱 개발을 지원한다.

2020년 출시한 KMM(Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile)이라고 하는 cross-platform 앱을 지원하는 SDK가 인기의 원인이다.

*cross-platform 또는 multi-platform은 하나의 소프트웨어가 여러 컴퓨터 플랫폼에서 동작하는 것을 의미*

### 특징

- cross-platform
- similar to Java and Swift - statically-typed programming language

### Kotlin으로 개발한 앱(2020년 기준)

Java보다 빠르게 개발이 가능하고, 효율적으로 협업이 가능하며, 수많은 실시간 트래픽을 안정적으로 감당할 수 있다.

- Google<br>→ Google has officially declared Kotlin as its first-class programming language for Android development
- Square<br>→ The company is dealing with software and hardware products and possesses quite a huge customer base. Kotlin helps them improve performance, speed, and productivity and that’s what Kotlin is designed to do.
- Trello<br>→ Trello team Kotlinized major functions and creating new features in Kotlin to leverage the benefits it has to offer.
- Evernote<br>→ Evernote uses Kotlin over java for stability, clarity, and speed in its Android app.
- Slack<br>→ According to its tech stack, it uses Kotlin in its android environment.
- Corda<br>→ Corda is an open-source Blockchain platform for businesses and it is entirely built in Kotlin language. JVM was their choice but Java langunage lacks modern convenience and significantly reduces developers’ productivity.They picked Kotlin because of its interoperability with Java, functional programming, and easier learning curve.
- Tinder<br>→ According to Stackshare.io, Tinder is using Kotlin in its production environment for concise and clear code architecture.
- N26<br>→ N26 is a leading German neobank offering its services across Europe and the United States. They have chosen Kotlin as their major development language for backend services because of Kotlin’s high performance and maturity of language.
- Netflix<br>→ They have rebuilt the current UI player in the Netflix Android app using 100% Kotlin.
- Airbnb<br>→ Airbnb dumped React Native and used Kotlin in a new android product framework (MvRx) for a seamless experience, according to its tech engineering blog.
- Basecamp<br>→ The application is written in Kotlin and it has made a difference in quality, speed, and performance, the team reported.
- Zomato<br>→ Zomato is a popular Indian restaurant finder and food delivery application having 80 million monthly active users. Zomato uses Kotlin to write more safe and concise code for its Android app. Kotlin has helped reduce the lines of code and also identify important defects during the compilation of code.

## § React Native

React Native는 2015년 Facebook이 개발한 오픈 소스 모바일 애플리케이션 프레임워크로, 안드로이드, IOS, 웹, UWP 등 다양한 애플리케이션 개발을 지원한다.

리액트와 거의 동일하며, HTML과 CSS 대신 JS를 통해 네이티브 뷰를 사용한다.

*UWP는 Universal Windows Platform의 약자로, 제각기 재개발할 필요 없이 윈도우 10, 윈도우 10 모바일, 엑스박스 원, 홀로렌즈에서 실행할 유니버설 앱의 개발을 돕기 위한 API다.*

### 특징

- Hybrid App(웹 기반 앱) - seamless & cross-platform
- JavaScript based framework, delivered in native code
- Live reloading of changed code without rebuilding

### React Native로 개발한 앱 TOP10 (2020년 기준)

안드로이드, ios, 웹앱 등 다양한 플랫폼에 동일한 애플리케이션을 지원하는 경우에 여러 측면에서 유용하다.

- Facebook, Facebook Ads Manager, Facebook Analytics
- Instagram
- Tableau
- Discord<br>→ React Native has helped their iOS and Android versions to share the same code almost entirely, facilitating faster development and easy maintenance.
- Skype<br>→ Skype has preferred using React Native in its cross-platform development wing, for its mobile apps and Windows desktop apps.
- Bloomberg<br>→ Because React Native gives a great experience with videos, content, and live feeds, it was chosen as the apt technology at Bloomberg. Automatic app reloads, code refreshing, and cross-platform native app features are some of the striking reasons it is chosen by Bloomberg.
- Pinterest<br>→ Using React Native, the initial implementation on iOS took about 10 days, including bootstrapping all the integrations into our existing infrastructure. We were then able to port the screen over to Android in two days with 100 percent shared UI code between the platforms, saving more than a week of implementation time. 
- Tesla<br>→ The popular Tesla app has its owners in straight communication with their vehicles. There is much you can do with this app – check to charge time, check car heating/cooling, locking / unlocking from far, finding or diagnosing your vehicle, etc.
- Uber Eats<br>→ There is a mobile / desktop-based dashboard for restaurants with different functionalities like push and sound notifications that have been created with React Native.
- Walmart<br>→ Most of the code of Walmart’s app has been seamlessly shared between iOS and Android versions. This has helped cut down on development costs and efforts.
- Tencent QQ

## § Statically-Typed(정적타입) VS Dynamically-Typed(동적타입) in Programming Language

||Statically-Typed|Dynamically-Typed|
|---|---|---|
|특징|코드에서 변수의 타입을 명시하여 컴파일 시 변수 타입을 결정|코드에서 타입 없이 변수만 선언하고 런타임 시 변수 타입을 결정|
|장점|* 타입 안정성이 높음: 타입 에러를 초기에 발견 가능<br>* 실행 속도가 빠름: 컴파일 시 변수의 타입을 결정|* 유연성이 높음: 런타임까지 타입을 결정하지 않아도 됨<br>* 코드 작성 속도가 빠름: 타입을 미리 결정하고 명시하지 않아도 됨|
|단점|* 코드 작성 시 변수형을 결정해야 해서 유연성이 낮음<br>* 코드 작서 속도가 지연될 수 있음|* 실행 속도가 느릴 수 있음<br>* 실행 도중에 예상치 못한 타입으로 타입 에러 발생 가능|
