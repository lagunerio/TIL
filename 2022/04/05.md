## CentOS 8

#### EOL: 2021. 12. 31.

It means that CentOS 8 will no longer receive development resources from the official CentOS project. 
After Dec 31st, 2021, if you need to update your CentOS, you need to change the mirrors to vault.centos.org where they will be archived permanently. 

Alternatively, you may want to upgrade to CentOS Stream.
